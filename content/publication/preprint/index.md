abstract: I examine the effect of local house price experiences on household labor supply using household-level data on labor income and hours worked from 1980. A within-household one-standard-deviation increase in experienced price growth (a weighted average of past price growth in local housing markets) leads to a 1 to 3 percentage points increase in households' real labor income. Results hold when using geographically distant relatives' experienced price growth as an instrument. Effects are similar for homeowners and renters and less pronounced for sophisticated households. Additional analyses reveal a positive relationship between experienced price growth and households' hours worked.
