I'm a PhD Finance Candidate at the City University of Hong Kong interested in household finance, labor, and behavioral economics and finance. I'm on the 2023/24 job market, and my job market paper focuses on the role of house price expectations in consumer spending decisions. My research has been accepted for presentation at international conferences, including the American Finance Association Annual Meeting and the Financial Management Association Annual Meeting.
